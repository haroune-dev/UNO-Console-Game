##  About

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic UNO card game developed in Java using object-oriented programming principles. It supports both single-player mode against a bot and local multiplayer for up to four players while following the standard UNO rules.

The project was built as an educational OOP project with a focus on clean code organization, inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

##  Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🤖 **Smart Bot AI** | Play against an intelligent bot that strategically picks cards based on color frequency and card type |
| 👥 **Multiplayer** | Support for 2, 3, or 4 human players on the same terminal |
| 🎨 **Colored Output** | ANSI color-coded cards (🔴 Red, 🔵 Blue, 🟢 Green, 🟡 Yellow) for an immersive experience |
| 🔄 **Full UNO Ruleset** | Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, and Wild Draw Four — all action cards implemented |
| 🏆 **Leaderboard & Scoring** | Track scores across multiple rounds with a ranked leaderboard |
| ⚡ **UNO Call Mechanic** | Forget to type "UNO" when you're down to one card? That's a 2-card penalty! |
| 🎬 **Typewriter Animations** | Smooth text animations and timed reveals for a polished feel |
| 🔁 **Multi-Round Support** | Play multiple rounds in a single session with persistent scoring |

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17** or higher — [Download here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- A terminal that supports **ANSI color codes** (Windows Terminal, Git Bash, macOS Terminal, Linux Terminal)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/haroune-dev/UNO-Console-Game.git

# 2. Navigate to the project directory
cd UNO-Console-Game

# 3. Compile the source files (Linux/macOS or Git Bash)
javac -d bin src/**/*.java

# On Windows CMD, use explicit paths:
javac -d bin src\cards\*.java src\deck\*.java src\player\*.java src\enumTypes\*.java src\game\*.java


# 4. Run the game
java -cp bin game.Drive
```

### Quick Start with Eclipse

1. **Import** the project into Eclipse (`File → Import → Existing Projects`)
2. **Run** `Drive.java` as a Java Application

###  Design Highlights

- **Abstract Card Hierarchy** — `Card` → `ColoredCard` / `WildCard` → Concrete cards. Each card type implements its own `matches()` and `applyEffect()` logic via polymorphism.
- **Separation of Concerns** — `GameController` handles rules and state, `GameSession` manages UI and player interaction, and `Drive` serves as the entry point.
- **Bot Strategy Pattern** — The bot selects cards based on a scoring algorithm that evaluates color frequency and card type in its hand.
- **Standard 108-Card Deck** — Faithfully implements the official UNO deck composition.

##  How to Play

1. Select a game mode.
2. Enter the player names.
3. Play a valid card or draw one from the deck.
4. Action cards apply their effects immediately.
5. If you have one card left, type `uno` before ending your turn.
6. The first player to empty their hand wins the round.
